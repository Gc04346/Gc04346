### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
##### My name is Daniel. I'm a Python developer.
My main field of work and of research is back-end development and machine learning using Python, specially using the Django Framework. But I know my way around front-end also. Javascript, HTML, CSS, none of those are strangers to me.
**Productivity** is key. I like to deliver the best i can, as quickly as possible.
 - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on mantaining and improving the internal system of Onimusic, a major christian music distributor in Brazil.
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Machine Learning, Computer Vision and AI algorithms.
 - âš¡ A little about myself: Ask me something about DC comic books, videogames, movies or TV shows. I wave the Nerdy t-shirt with pride. I also love music, swimming and hanging out with my friends. On my free time you usually will find me playing on my computer, playing cards with my family or at the mall with my friends, just passing time.
 - ðŸ“« If you want to get in touch with me, the easiest way would be to send me a [direct message](https://www.instagram.com/d.ssantos_/) on Instagram. Also, in [my website](https://gc04346.github.io/danielSantana/) you'll find all my additional contact info.
