### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
##### My name is Daniel. I'm a Python developer.
My main field of work is back-end development using Python, specially using the Django Framework. But I know my way around front-end also. Javascript, HTML, CSS, and React aren't strangers to me. I also know a little bit about DevOps, with a bit of experience with Ansible and Vagrant.
**Productivity** is key. I like to deliver the best i can, as quickly as possible.
 - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on mantaining and improving several internal systems at Onimusic, a major christian music distributor in Brazil.
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Microservices Architectures and Cloud Computing.
 - âš¡ A little about myself: Ask me something about DC comic books, videogames, movies or TV shows. I wave the Nerdy t-shirt with pride. I also love music, swimming and hanging out with my friends. On my free time you usually will find me playing on my computer, playing cards with my family or at the mall with my friends, just passing time.
 - ðŸ“« If you want to get in touch with me, the easiest way would be to send me a [direct message](https://www.instagram.com/d.ssantos_/) on Instagram. Also, in [my website](https://gc04346.github.io/danielSantana/) you'll find all my additional contact info.
